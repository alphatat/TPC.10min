    <string name="anleitung">Welcome to Tomato Potato Clock. This is a classic pomodoro timer (this version: distraction-free). Right now: Alternating sections of 25 and 5 minutes - running in perpetuity (till stop/close app). \n\nIf you found this app, you know what kind of person you are ;). Hence, there no options at all and you also cannot pause the timer. This is part of the design of this app. Good luck with your endeavours.\n\nGifted to you be Valentin ♥️.
