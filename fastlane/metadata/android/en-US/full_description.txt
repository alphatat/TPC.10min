Welcome to Tomato Potato Clock. This is a classic pomodoro timer (this version: distraction-free). Right now: Alternating sections of 25 and 5 minutes - running in perpetuity (till stop/close app). 
If you found this app, you know what kind of person you are ;). Hence, there no options at all and you also cannot pause the timer. This is part of the design of this app. Good luck with your endeavours.
 
<b>Features</b>

- ⚫ Distraction-free: No status or navigation bar, no numbers, no letters - just visual and acoustic feedback of time. 
- 🎶 Sounds: A sound is played each time a new slice/section begins.

Gifted to you by Valentin ❤️
